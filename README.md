Robustness of federated learning - BSc

## Main Focus
On robustness of FL  for cross-silo systems, under missing data issues. 


## Research project in robust distributed learning (federated learning) for healthcare applications

We are seeking individuals interested in advancing and translating AI research in robust-learning in a distributed setting, for application in (mental) healthcare. This project will be on the lines of federated learning (FL) with a focus on robustness, reliability and safety of AI models withing high-stake applications. We at DTU Computeâ€™s Lab in Human Sensored AI are offering BSc and MSc projects within this scope to support our team's research. The project/s is open-ended due to the nature of the problem and will be focused on scoping, investigating and developing the application of FL in healthcare with multi-modal data (vision, speech and physiological signals).

We would specifically like to invite individuals interested in research and who would like to pursue this direction for a thesis (with a potential for publications). It is also possible to design a research-based special course on the above topic and combine the thesis with a special course for scoping and mapping interesting research questions. This project will be in collaboration with researchers from DIKU (Copenhagen University) and the child and adolescent mental health center in Copenhagen (CAMHC). If this topic gets your interest, please contact me (Sneha Das, sned@dtu.dk).
